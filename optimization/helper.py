    """ Compute the Euclidean projection on a positive simplex
    Solves the optimisation problem (using the algorithm from [1]):
        min_w 0.5 * || w - v ||_2^2 , s.t. \sum_i w_i = s, w_i >= 0 
    Parameters
    ----------
    v: (n,) numpy array,
       n-dimensional vector to project
    s: int, optional, default: 1,
       radius of the simplex
    Returns
    -------
    w: (n,) numpy array,
       Euclidean projection of v on the simplex
    Notes
    -----
    The complexity of this algorithm is in O(n log(n)) as it involves sorting v.
    Better alternatives exist for high-dimensional sparse vectors (cf. [1])
    However, this implementation still easily scales to millions of dimensions.
